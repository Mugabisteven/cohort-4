/*In conclusion; this program computes the final mark.
Firstly, the Coursework is computed from a mandatory mark 
and an avarage of two tests; the result of printed before 
furter manipulation through the average function.
Finally, a percentage of the courseork and exam marks are 
computed and added to achieve the Student's Mark out of 100%.
Lastly; the Final Mark is also printed out. */
